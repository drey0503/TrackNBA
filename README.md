## Running
If a developer were to clone this report they would have to set up the virtual Pixel 2 API 30, and press 
the play button to run the application.

## Deployment
To run this app on a mobile device, you need to download the .apk on that device. 
When we tested running an android studio app on an android smartphone, we sent the .apk
file to the phone and downloaded it on the device.
